The DRM (Digital Rights Management) is an addition to the Palm DOC
format. The most usefull part of these changes for most people will be
the zlib compression which is quite a bit better than the RLE
compression used in standard DOC files.

The way it is implemented to try not to break most DOC readers is by
using a DOC version number higher than normally used. The current
implementations use 1 as non-compressed and 2 as RLE compressed. I've
added a block of numbers from 0x100 (256) to 0x1ff (511) to represent
the DRM encrypted files. The exception is 0x100 is a plain zlib
compressed DOC. All encrypted files will use zlib compression. The
reader will not enforce this as the DRM module will be responsible for
the decompress.

0x100  zlib compressed DOC with no encryption.
0x101  simple add 13 encryption as a demonstration.
0x102  Embiid book.
0x103 - 0x1ff unassigned.

If you are a publisher and want a number assigned please ask. It is
expected that a publisher actually using this system will insert their
own encryption. I'm not going to give advice on how to do this.

This modified C Spot Run will link to a DRM module called csrdrmXX
where the XX is the hex digits 00 through FF. The module has a creator
id of 'CS\xf3\xXX where the XX is the same as the XX in the name. These
digits correspond with the 0x100 through 0x1FF version numbers. The
decompress step is performed by the DRM module. A module called
csrdrm00 implements plain zlib decompression.
