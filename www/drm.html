    <h2>CSpotRun Digital Rights Management (DRM)</h2>
	<p>
	The DRM (Digital Rights Management) is an addition to the Palm DOC
	format. The most useful part of these changes for most people will be
	the zlib compression which is quite a bit better than the RLE
	compression used in standard DOC files.
	<p>
	The way it is implemented to try not to break most DOC readers is by
	using a DOC version number higher than normally used. The current
	implementations use 1 as non-compressed and 2 as RLE compressed. I've
	added a block of numbers from 0x100 (256) to 0x1ff (511) to represent
	the DRM encrypted files. The exception is 0x100 is a plain zlib
	compressed DOC. All encrypted files will use zlib compression. The
	reader will not enforce this as the DRM module will be responsible for
	the decompress.
	<p>
	0x100  zlib compressed DOC with no encryption.
	0x101  simple add 13 encryption as a demonstration.
	0x102  Embiid book.
	0x103 - 0x1ff unassigned.
	<p>
	If you are a publisher and want a number assigned please ask. It is
	expected that a publisher actually using this system will insert their
	own encryption. I'm not going to give advice on how to do this.
	<p>
	This modified C Spot Run will link to a DRM module called csrdrmXX
	where the XX is the hex digits 00 through FF. The module has a creator
	id of 'CS\xf3\xXX where the XX is the same as the XX in the name. These
	digits correspond with the 0x100 through 0x1FF version numbers. The
	decompress step is performed by the DRM module. A module called
	csrdrm00 implements plain zlib decompression.
