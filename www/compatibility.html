    <h2>CSpotRun Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      CSpotRun has been tested under Palm OS versions 2.0 through 4.1.
      It does not work under version 1.
      I have spent some time on this. Palm OS version 1 is missing several features which
      CSpotRun uses. To implement this functionality would require a lot of work
      and a lot of code. And it would be a larger program. So, I have chosen to
      stick with Palm OS 2 as baseline operating system.
    </p><p>
      <b>Note to TealDoc users:</b>Occasionally documents which a users has viewed with TealDoc
      are not shown in CSpotRun's document list. Fixing this is really easy; Start up TealDoc
      and choose "All to public format" from the "Doc" menu.
      (If you're interested, TealDoc changes the creator id of doc databases from "REAd" to "TIDc".
      So, CSpotRun and other document readers can no longer recognize the databases as DOC files.)
