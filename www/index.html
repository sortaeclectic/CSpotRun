			CSpotRun is a free reader for documents in the popular Pilot DOC format.
		</p><p>
			There are a couple of nice commercial readers on the market.
			CSpotRun is targeted at those of us who do not use
			a reader enough to justify spending the money on one.
			It was designed to be smaller and simpler than the commercial
			readers. As features have been added, it hasn't stayed all that small!
			But it is not too very big just yet.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>
				The <a href="releases.html#latest">latest version </a>
				of CSpotRun is available for download in either
				<a href=CSpotRun_english.zip>English</a>,
				<a href=CSpotRun_spanish.zip>Spanish</a>,
				or <a href=CSpotRun_german.zip>German</a>.
			</b>
			Notable  <a href=releases.html>older versions</a> are available

		<p>
			I get a lot of email asking where to find DOC files on the Internet,
			how to make DOC files, how to get DOC files onto a PalmPilot, etc.
			Many people have answered these questions
			more thoroughly than I can. You should probably look at the help or FAQs at
			<a href="http://www.memoware.com/">MemoWare</a>, or
			<a href="http://www.pilotlibrary.org/">The PalmPilot Library</a>.
			<b>Please note that CSpotRun has nothing to do with Microsoft Word files.
			Moreover, it will not work on any type of Windows CE device, regardless of whether or not it has the word
			"Palm" in its name.</b> Trust me on this one.

		<h2>CSpotRun Features</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>Selectable Fonts
			<dd><image src="fontsizebuttons.gif">
				Click the font buttons to change the font used to view the document.

			<dt>Selectable Line Spacing
			<dd><image src="lineheightbuttons.gif">
				Click the linespacing buttons to change the line spacing used to
				view the document. The largest spacing is the standard line spacing.
				Smaller spacings let you fit a few more lines on the page.

			<dt>Per-Document Preferences
			<dd>Font and line spacing preferences are saved seperately for each
				document. When you open a document for the first time, it gets the
				default settings. To save the current document's settings as the default
				settings, select the "Make Settings Default" option.

			<dt>Landscape Mode
			<dd>I know that the screen is square! This makes reading long documents more comfortable
				for some users, especially those with smaller hands. You can also reverse the
				behavior of the page up and page down when the text is sideways.

			<dt>Unlimited number of documents
			<dd>The number of documents is limited by available memory, of course.
				But it is not arbitrarily imposed by CSpotRun as in some readers.

			<dt>Jump to
			<dd>Positions to jump to are in 10% increments. This is quicker
				than entering the exact percentage.

			<dt>Full Screen View
			<dd>The on-screen controls can be hidden by choosing "Toggle Controls" from the
				"Options" menu.  (Even better, use menu shortcut T.)

			<dt>Configurable User Interface
			<dd>Choose "Controls..." from the "Options" menu.  From this window, the user can
				choose exactly which controls appear on the screen. Note that it will not allow
				you to remove all controls from the screen.  To do this use the "Toggle Controls"
				menu item. For convenience, each on-screen control has a corresponding menu item
				in the "Controls" menu. Use these menu items if the control you need is currently
				hidden.

			<dt>The goofy name
			<dd><a rev=made href="mailto:marnie.clagett@pobox.com">My wife</a> thought of it.
				It's sort of a pun. "See Spot Run" was a
				phrase from a beginning simple reading book from grade school. CSpotRun is a
				simple DOC reader. Get it? Thanks to those of you who have suggested alternate
				names. But, I think "CSpotRun" is going to stick. Plus it allows me to use the
				coolest icon ever.

		</dl>

		<h2>Current Status of Your Favorite Missing Feature</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>Searching
			<dd>Hopefully, searching will be added soon. Searching via the "Find" facility won't be added initally
				but may follow shortly.

			<dt>Bookmarks
			<dd>Everyone seems to want bookmarks. These will probably be added in some form.
				To scan for bookmarks, a search function should be implemented first.

			<dt>Images, tags, hyperlinks, etc.
			<dd>Don't hold your breath. These will likely never be added.

			<dt>Renaming Documents
			<dd>People have mentioned this. No one seems to feel too strongly about it though. So, I am
				not really considering it.

			<dt>Private Documents
			<dd>There is someinterest in being able to mark documents as private. Sounds like a good
				feature to add down the road.

			<dt>Heirarchial View of Related Documents, Categories, etc.
			<dd>Users have suggested all sorts of possibilities for organizing many documents.
				Sounds neat, but more complicated than it is worth. For now,
				alphabetizing documents by name will suffice.

			<dt>Auto Scroll
			<dd>Automatic scrolling has been mentioned by a couple of people. Sort of useful, but
				there are several higher priorities.

			<dt>Internationalization
			<dd>I wouldn't mind doing this for additional languages, provided someone will translate strings for me.

			<dt>Show More Information
			<dd>Some people want to see the size of a document, number of lines in a document,
				number of pages, etc.

			<dt>Copy From Document
			<dd>This would be neat. Because of the way text is drawn in CSpotRun, this is
				more difficult than most people expect.

			<dt>Beaming
			<dd>Should be doable. I'll look into it.

			<dt>Flash
			<dd>Evidently, CSpotRun behaves strangely when put in flash memory. Should look into this.
		</dl>

		<h2>Compatibility</h2>
		<p>
			CSpotRun has been tested under OS2 and OS3. It does not work under OS1.
			I have spent some time on this. OS1 is missing several features which
			CSpotRun uses. To implement this functionality would require a lot of work
			and a lot of code. And it would be a larger program. So, I have chosen to
			stick with OS2 as baseline operating system.
		</p><p>
			<b>Note to TealDoc users:</b>Occasionally documents which a users has viewed with TealDoc
			are not shown in CSpotRun's document list. Fixing this is really easy; Start up TealDoc
			and choose "All to public format" from the "Doc" menu.
			(If you're interested, TealDoc changes the creator id of doc databases from "REAd" to "TIDc".
			So, CSpotRun and other document readers can no longer recognize the databases as DOC files.)
