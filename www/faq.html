    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Where do I get DOC files?
	    <dd>You can download a many pre-made docs at
	       <a href="http://www.memoware.com/">MemoWare</a>.
        <dt>How do I get my Microsoft Word documents into CSpotRun?
        <dd>The Pilot DOC format is not the same as the Microsoft Word format.
            Not even a little.
            There does exist software to convert Microsoft Word documents
		    into the Pilot DOC format. A few are listed at
		    <a href="http://www.memoware.com/mw-helpm.htm">another MemoWare page</a>.
        <dt>How do I install DOC files on my Palm thingy?
        <dd>You should have downloaded a .pdb file to your desktop. Double-click it.
            You'll figure out the rest.
        <dt>I deleted a single document and all of my documents disappeared. What gives?
        <dd>You used the built-in Palm launcher's delete
            facility. It thinks you are deleting an application and tries to clean up
            related databases. In this case, those are your other documents. To work
            around this, use the "Delete Doc" menu item in CSpotRun's "Doc" menu.
<!--
		<dt>Last year I asked you to add a hyper-bookmark-text-discombobulation-facility.
	        When are you going to add it?
		<dd>I'm pretty much done with CSpotRun.
            The source code is open. I try to
            support people who are interested in contributing features. And I will
            try to find time to fix any sufficiently heinous bugs.
