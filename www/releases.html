      <dt>1.2.6 January 4, 2003
      <dd>Changed to take advantage of high-density fonts under OS 5.
	  <b>With this version, rotating the screen does not work 
	     on OS 5 devices.</b> I haven't been been able to rotate
	     a high-density bitmap correctly yet. I'd prefer to figure
	     it out before releasing this, but the volume of email 
	     indicates that people really, really want the high-density 
	     fonts.

      <dt>1.2.5 December 12, 2002
      <dd>Fixed bug where the rightmost pixel could be missing on lines
          beginning with a space and filling the entire line. Internally,
	  switched to OS5 header files.

      <dt>1.2.4 June 25, 2002
      <dd>Support for the Sony Jog Dial from Jesús Jiménez.
         <a href=http://32768.com/cspotrun/download/1_2_4>[Download]</a>
      <dt>1.2.3 June 4, 2002
      <dd>Fixed crash when CSpotRun is running in ROM (flash). (Okay,
          so I didn't actually change anything. I just used the newer
          version of prc-tools, wherein this bug is fixed.)
      <dt>1.2.2 Febuary April 30, 2002
      <dd>Florian fixed auto-scrolling bug in long documents which
	  had snuck into 1.2.
         <a href=http://32768.com/cspotrun/download/1_2_2>[Download]</a>
      <dt>1.2.1 Febuary 11, 2002
      <dd>Fixed crash in preferences. (Oops.)
         <a href=http://32768.com/cspotrun/download/1_2_1>[Download]</a>
      <dt>1.2 Febuary 10, 2002
      <dd>Added hyphenation and justification from Florian Deckert.
      	  Added support for
      	  <a href='drm.html'>
      	  Digital Rights Management (DRM) libraries
      	  </a>
      	  from Greg Weeks. Moved autoscroll and rotation menu
      	  items to the Options menu. Change font selection UI
	  to use the standard OS font selector. (Inspired by
	  a change Dan Fahrion had made to his Handera 330-compatible
	   version.)
      	  <br>(Developer only stuff: Went multisegment, so that the
      	  DEBUG=1 version will continue to link. Added the HTML that you're
      	  reading to the zip archive. Started linking in PalmOSGlue to
      	  maintain compatibility with old versions. Changed rotate.c
      	  to silence emulator warnings.)
      <dt>1.1.2 December 13, 2001
      <dd>Fixed rotation for OS 3.0-3.3, which I had completely
	  broken in the move to 4.0 headers.
         <a href=http://32768.com/cspotrun/download/1_1_2>[Download]</a>
      <dt>1.1.1 December 12, 2001
      <dd>Tidied up menu by moving some bookmark stuff to the bookmark
	  form. Started using PalmOS 4.0 header files. (Sheesh.)
	  A little (very little) internal clean up work that nobody
	  else cares about.
      <dt>1.1 August 7, 2001
      <dd>Bookmarks from Alexey Raschepkin.

      <dt>1.0.5 March 11, 2000
      <dd>
         Finally fixed drawing bug after returning from preferences
         as reported by Dan Pelleg.
         Added error check for bad documents which could have caused a crash.
         (One specific type of badness. There are probably others.)
         Fixed incorrect display of some Czech and Japanese characters.
         (Ivo Panacek did the hard work of tracking this down.)
         Made pixel scrolling smoother.

      <dd>
      <dt>1.0 Febuary 27, 2000
      <dd>
         Traditional chinese translation from Chen-hsiung Chan.
         Fixed two 0.9.9 drawing bugs.
         Fixed OS2 rotation bug reported by Paul Bookham.
         Miscellaneous localization tweaks.
      <dt>0.9.9 Feb 12, 2000
      <dd>
        Swedish localization from Jonas Kampe.
        Option to choose pixel-wise or line-wise scrolling from Daniel Zahn.
        Changed to always switch screen into 1-bit mode
        instead of trying to deal with arbitrary bit depth.
        Made it work under OS 3.5.
        Lots of nice localization polishing from many people.
      <dt>0.9.6 Jan 17, 2000
      <dd>
        Pixel-wise scrolling from Daniel Zahn.
        Option to disable hard button scrolling control from Daniel Zahn.
        Scrolling tweaking for the rotated case.
        sysAppLaunchCmdOpenDB support from Zack Hobson.
        Turkish translation from Selcuk Demiray.
        pt_PT tranlation from Carlos Morgado.
        Renamed existing Portuguese translation to pt_BR.
        <a href=http://32768.com/cspotrun/download/0p9p6>[Download]</a>.
      <dt>0.9 Dec 7, 1999
      <dd>Added Auto-scrolling by Daniel Zahn. Added Czech translation from Ivo Panacek.
      <dt>0.8.1 Nov 17, 1999
      <dd>Added Portuguese translation from Rui A. Rebelo. Fixed the stray beep when opening the the
          find dialog with a menu.
      <dt>0.8 Nov 12, 1999
      <dd>Added searching within a document. Added French version, thanks to Vincent Poty.
          Changed end-of-document behavior. (It no longer insists on filling up the entire screen.)
          Modulated the shield harmonics. Tweaks to rotation code.
      <dt>0.6.1 Oct 24, 1999
      <dd>Fixed bug I introduced while cleaning up the rotation code which caused a crash under OS2.

      <dt>0.6 Oct 22, 1999
      <dd>Got rid of "inheritance" of preferences. Instead, there is a menu item to make the current
        settings the default. Laid some groundwork for searching.
        Added small icon for OS3's launcher.
        Fixed gray text when in 2-bit mode.
        <br>
        <em>
        CSpotRun is finally OPEN SOURCE under
        <a href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.
        There are several embarassing bits of code and experiments in coding styles in here that
        I'd like to clean up.
        But if I waited until I fixed them before releasing the source, I may never get the source out.
		</em>
      <dt>0.5.2 Oct 18, 1998
      <dd>Added Spanish translation. Many thanks to Marcelo Rinesi for this translation!
        Also fixed incompatibility with "jwolcal2.pbd". (This looks like a bug in the compression program used on this
        document.) Thanks to Louis Lauzon for reporting this, and for being patient with my taking way too
        long to fix it. <a href=http://32768.com/cspotrun/download/0p5p2>[Download]</a>.

      <dt>0.5.1 Oct 12, 1998
      <dd>Minor fix. Added a missing German translation. Fixed bug causing a crash when a document is
        replaced with a shorter one having the same name. Silly oversight. Thanks to Jonathan Markevich
        for bringing this to my attention.

      <dt>0.5 Oct 8, 1998
      <dd>There is now a German version! Many thanks to Arne Nickel for the translation.
        Internationalization required a few minor GUI tweaks even in the English version.
        Fixed some very strange behavior found by Izya Yagolnitser when reading a certain
        document. (In case you're interested, it seems that in QED-generated documents, record
        lengths don't match the record length specified in the header.) Also sped up the text
        drawing code just a tiny bit.

      <dt>0.4 Oct 5, 1998
      <dd>Big changes. Added screen rotating. Made display of line from previous page on
        page up/down optional. Added options for tapping the screen to move a line,
        half-page, or page. Fixed bug which made first line of page sometime start in
        mid-line. (Thanks for John Verne for pointing this out.) Wrote some help.
        Reworked menus and dialogs to be prettier. Made a document "inherit" the current
        documents settings when you open it for the first time. (Thanks to Frank Fejes for
        some great constructive pickyness!) Alphabetized document list. Laid groundwork
        for easier internationalization of strings.

      <dt>0.3 Sept 19, 1998
      <dd>Added the configurable user interface and full screen view. Also added the
        Palm III's large bold font. It's very readable. (Thanks to Stephen Millman
        for this suggestion!)

      <dt>0.2 Sept 15, 1998
      <dd>Minor fix. The last character of some documents was not displayed. Fixed this.
        (Thanks to Rob Sherrard for discovering this bug!) Cleaned up some code,
        shrinking the .PRC a bit.
        This is a nice, small (8k) version. You can

      <dt>0.1 Sept 14, 1998
      <dd>Minor fix. Added processing of carraige returns in addition to newlines.
        (Thanks to Randy Hartley for pointing out the need for this.)

      <dt>0.0 Sept 13, 1998
      <dd>Initial version
