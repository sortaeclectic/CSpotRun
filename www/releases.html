			<dt>0.0 Sept 13, 1998
			<dd>Initial version
			<dt>0.1 Sept 14, 1998
			<dd>Minor fix. Added processing of carraige returns in addition to newlines.
				(Thanks to Randy Hartley for pointing out the need for this.)
			<dt>0.2 Sept 15, 1998
			<dd>Minor fix. The last character of some documents was not displayed. Fixed this.
				(Thanks to Rob Sherrard for discovering this bug!) Cleaned up some code,
				shrinking the .PRC a bit.
				This is a nice, small (8k) version. You can
				<a href=0p2>download this version as a zip archive</a>.
			<dt>0.3 Sept 19, 1998
			<dd>Added the configurable user interface and full screen view. Also added the
				Palm III's large bold font. It's very readable. (Thanks to Stephen Millman
				for this suggestion!)
			<dt>0.4 Oct 5, 1998
			<dd>Big changes. Added screen rotating. Made display of line from previous page on
				page up/down optional. Added options for tapping the screen to move a line,
				half-page, or page. Fixed bug which made first line of page sometime start in
				mid-line. (Thanks for John Verne for pointing this out.) Wrote some help.
				Reworked menus and dialogs to be prettier. Made a document "inherit" the current
				documents settings when you open it for the first time. (Thanks to Frank Fejes for
				some great constructive pickyness!) Alphabetized document list. Laid groundwork
				for easier internationalization of strings.
			<dt>0.5 Oct 8, 1998
			<dd>There is now a German version! Many thanks to Arne Nickel for the translation.
				Internationalization required a few minor GUI tweaks even in the English version.
				Fixed some very strange behavior found by Izya Yagolnitser when reading a certain
				document. (In case you're interested, it seems that in QED-generated documents, record
				lengths don't match the record length specified in the header.) Also sped up the text
				drawing code just a tiny bit.
			<dt>0.5.1 Oct 12, 1998
			<dd>Minor fix. Added a missing German translation. Fixed bug causing a crash when a document is
				replaced with a shorter one having the same name. Silly oversight. Thanks to Jonathan Markevich
				for bringing this to my attention.
			<dt>0.5.2 Oct 18, 1998
			<dd>Added Spanish translation. Many thanks to Marcelo Rinesi for this translation!
				Also fixed incompatibility with "jwolcal2.pbd". (This looks like a bug in the compression program used on this
				document.) Thanks to Louis Lauzon for reporting this, and for being patient with my taking way too
				long to fix it. You can <a href=0p5p2>download this version as a zip archive</a>.
			<dt>0.6 Oct 22, 1999
			<dd>Got rid of "inheritance" of preferences. Instead, there is a menu item to make the current
				settings the default. Laid some groundwork for searching.
				Added small icon for OS3's launcher.
				Fixed gray text when in 2-bit mode.
				<br>
				CSpotRun is finally OPEN SOURCE under
				<a href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.
				There are several embarassing bits of code in here that I'd like to clean up.
				But if I waited until I fixed them before releasing the source, I may never get the source out.
			<dt>0.6.1 Oct 24, 1999
			<dd>Fixed bug I introduced while cleaning up the rotation code which caused a crash under OS2.
			    You can <a href=0p6p1>download this version as a zip archive</a>.
			<dt>0.8 Nov 12, 1999
			<dd>Added searching within a document. Added French version, thanks to Vincent Poty.
			    Changed end-of-document behavior. (It no longer insists on filling up the entire screen.)
			    Modulated the shield harmonics. Tweaks to rotation code.
			    You can <a href=0p8>download this version as a zip archive</a>.
			<dt>0.8.1 Nov 17, 1999
			<dd>Added Portuguese translation from Rui A. Rebelo. Fixed the stray beep when opening the the
			    find dialog with a menu.
			    You can <a href=0p8p1>download this version as a zip archive</a>.
			<dt>0.9 Dec 7, 1999
                Added Auto-scrolling by Daniel Zahn.
