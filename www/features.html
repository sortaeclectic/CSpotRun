    <h2>CSpotRun Features</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Selectable Fonts
      <dd><img src="fontsizebuttons.gif">
        Click the font buttons to change the font used to view the document.

      <dt>Selectable Line Spacing
      <dd><img src="lineheightbuttons.gif">
        Click the linespacing buttons to change the line spacing used to
        view the document. The largest spacing is the standard line spacing.
        Smaller spacings let you fit a few more lines on the page.

      <dt>Per-Document Preferences
      <dd>Font and line spacing preferences are saved seperately for each
        document. When you open a document for the first time, it gets the
        default settings. To save the current document's settings as the default
        settings, select the "Make Settings Default" option.

      <dt>Landscape Mode
      <dd><img src="rotatebuttons.gif">
          I know that the screen is square! This makes reading
          long documents more comfortable
        for some users, especially those with smaller hands. You can also reverse the
        behavior of the page up and page down when the text is sideways.

      <dt>Unlimited number of documents
      <dd>The number of documents is limited by available memory, of course.
        But it is not arbitrarily imposed by CSpotRun as in some readers.

      <dt>Jump to
      <dd><img src="jumptobuttons.gif">
          Positions to jump to are in 10% increments. This is quicker
        than entering the exact percentage.

      <dt>Full Screen View
      <dd>The on-screen controls can be hidden by choosing "Toggle Controls" from the
        "Options" menu.  (Even better, use menu shortcut T.)

      <dt>Configurable User Interface
      <dd>Choose "Controls..." from the "Options" menu.  From this window, the user can
        choose exactly which controls appear on the screen. Note that it will not allow
        you to remove all controls from the screen.  To do this use the "Toggle Controls"
        menu item. For convenience, each on-screen control has a corresponding menu item
        in the "Controls" menu. Use these menu items if the control you need is currently
        hidden.

      <dt>Search
      <dd><img src="searchbuttons.gif">
          Searches for text in the current document.

      <dt>Auto Scroll
      <dd><img src="autoscrollbuttons.gif">
          Auto Scroll allows you to read long documents without constantly hitting the
          page down button. Auto scroll can be configure to scroll one line at a time or
          one pixel at a time.
          The speed can be set in the Preferences window. The speed can also be adjusted
          while auto scrolling using the page up/down buttons.

      <dt>Bookmarks
      <dd><img src="bookmarks.gif">
        Bookmarks let you quickly jump to other locations in the document.

      <dt>The goofy name
      <dd>
        It's sort of a pun. "See Spot Run" was a
        phrase from a beginning simple reading book from grade school. CSpotRun is a
        simple DOC reader. Get it? Thanks to those of you who have suggested alternate
        names. But, I think "CSpotRun" is going to stick. Plus it allows me to use the
        coolest icon ever.
