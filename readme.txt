Optional Hyphenation Database
	If the .zip file you downloaded included a file named named
	"CSpotRun_hyphen_english.pdb", then hyphenation is available for your 
	language. This database is optional. It contains information needed 
	about your language to perform hyphenation. If you're trying to save
